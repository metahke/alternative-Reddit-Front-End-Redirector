A simple Firefox browser extension that allows `www.reddit.com` to be automatically redirected to an alternative, private front-end `libreddit.bus-hit.me`.

## Manual

1. Download the contents of the repository,
2. Extract the archive to a location of your choice,
3. In the FireFox browser, open a new tab, type `about:debugging` and click "This FireFox" on the left panel,
4. Press the ‘Load Temporary Add-on’ button,
5. Select the `manifest.json` file from the downloaded repository,
6. Make sure that the add-on has been activated correctly.

That's it - from now on, URLs `www.reddit.com` will be automatically redirected to `libreddit.bus-hit.me`.
